Weezer – Quick Start

A full-stack social platform running with Docker Compose.

Start the project: 
docker compose up

This starts all services:
backend · frontend · mysql · localstack · sockets


Run a single service:

docker compose up backend  
docker compose up frontend  
docker compose up mysql  
docker compose up localstack  


Config

All environment variables and ports are defined in docker-compose.yml.

Each service has its own Dockerfile (backend/, frontend/, io/, etc.).

Services communicate internally using Docker service names (e.g., mysql, backend).
